    <h1>What is Swirled World?</h1>
    <p>It's very simple.</p>
    <p>
      Program uses the Twitter API to search your query, takes the top ten most
      popular posts that come up, extracts all the words from those posts,
      shuffles them randomly, creates lines of the poem by taking words at
      random from all the extracted words, and finally displays the result on
      the webpage.
    </p>
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <p>
      You will notice that some words return no results. This is because Twitter
      API was not able to find posts for your query. Also, you are only able to
      create a poem using maximum of two words.
